## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of PostgreSQL to analyze user submission data from a mock application. 
The dataset contains information about user activity, including submissions, points earned, timestamps, and user statistics. The project addresses real-world data analysis scenarios using SQL queries.
## Objectives
- Learn how to use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, EXTRACT(), and RANK().
- Develop skills for performance analysis using SQL by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.
## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of SQL and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used SQL queries to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.
## Dataset Description
- User ID
- Question ID
- Points Earned
- Submission Timestamp
- Username
### SQL Problems and Questions
Here are the SQL problems that I have solved as part of this project:
### Q1. List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
 - Expected Output: A list of users with their submission count and total points.
### Q2. Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
 - Expected Output: A report showing the average points per user for each day.
### Q3. Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
 - Expected Output: A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.
### Q4. Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
 - Expected Output: A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.
### Q5. Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
 - Expected Output: A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week
## Key SQL Concepts Covered
- Aggregation: Using COUNT, SUM, AVG to aggregate data.
- Date Functions: Using EXTRACT() and TO_CHAR() for manipulating dates.
- Conditional Aggregation: Using CASE WHEN to handle positive and negative submissions.
- Ranking: Using DENSE_RANK() to rank users based on their performance.
- Group By: Aggregating results by groups (e.g., by user, by day, by week).
## Conclusion
This project provides an excellent opportunity for me as a beginners to gain SQL knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these SQL queries, I gain hands-on experience with data aggregation, ranking, date manipulation, and conditional logic.
